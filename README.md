# React-NetCore-CRUD-full
- This is the merged repo for both front end and the back end

## Back End Repo (.NET Core) with all commits
- https://github.com/ishmamanwar/React-NetCore-CRUD
## Front end Repo (React.js with hooks) with all commits

### Screen Recording is uploaded as an .mp4 file on the repository displaying the features
- https://github.com/ishmamanwar/React-NetCore-CRUD-full/blob/master/recordedVideo.mp4
### The dropdown list features dont show on the recording for some reason thats why I have added screenshots for those on this repository too
